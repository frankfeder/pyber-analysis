# PyBer Ridesharing Data Analysis
Analysis using ipython notebooks to merge, summarize, and visualize data relating to "PyBer" ridesharing revenue across Urban, Suburban, and Rural regions over the same period of time.

## Overview
After performing an EDA on the provided data (see PyBer.ipynb) and performing bubble plot, box-and-whiskers, and pie chart visualizations on the data, management has requested a visualization comparing weekly revenues across the three region classifications. As this analysis works towards that, we will create and clean some summary statistics for each region types to compare differences in average fares per ride, and average fares per driver.
